All code and schematics used for our autonomous car

Autonomous code revised is the running code for the car
Automodule is the library "Autonomous code revised" calls from

The ".tar" file has both the module and main code in it

All documentation for our "REST_Board" is found in the RESTBOARD zip and the board and schematic files in the "rest" files respectively.
